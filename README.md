## Introduction  
  
The BIOME metagenomic public database contains 5272 metagenomic samples collected from MG-RAST and NCBI databases. The samples were recategorized based on two methods, the authoral BIOME classification and the IUCN classification.  
These datbase comprimises other works of the lab, such as:
- [Aquifers Landscapes](https://github.com/MeirellesLab/aquifer_metagenomes)
- [New Microbial Keystones](https://github.com/MeirellesLab/keystones_paper)

## Data organization
- **The [data_processing](data_processing/) contains step-by-step used to process the data.**  
```
From the data_processing folder and scripts we produced the data contained in all bellow.
For more Details, please check the [readme](data_processing/README.md) file.
```

- The [annotated_metagenomes](annotated_metagenomes/) contains the taxonomic relative and absolute abundance matrices generated by Kraken2 using the standard and Biome database.   
- The [metadata](metadata/) contains the BIOME and IUCN classifications of these samples.   
- The [summaries](summaries/) folder contains information about the samples, such as the number of reads, GC content, etc.
