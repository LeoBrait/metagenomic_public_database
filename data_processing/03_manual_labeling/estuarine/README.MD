1. This README is for documentating any alterations and observations in made in the datasets.

#Alterations

##General:
 - minor changes in coordinates incongruences

##Specific:

1. Target
```
mgm4759283
mgm4759284
mgm4759285
mgm4759286
```
Alteration: removed these samples because they are assembled. 
Since they are all the samples from the "brackish water environment.csv" dataset, I removed the dataset.

2. Target
```

mgm4506448
mgm4523017
mgm4523018

```
Alteration: removed for beeing private data

```
Alteration: changed the habitat from "estuarine_seawater" to "coastal_seawater" because in these samples the material is coastal waters 
and the coordinates lead to a coastal location.

```
Alteration: changed the habitat from "estuarine_seawater" to "river", the ecosystem from "saline_water" to "freshwater" and the biosphere from "marine" to "freshwater" because in these samples the material is freshwater and the coordinates lead to a river location.

5. Target
```

```
Alteration: Removed for beind assembled.
