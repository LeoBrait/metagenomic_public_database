This sample is from wood in decomposition in sea water from 500 m depth. New habitat: wood_decomposition; new ecosystem: saline_water; new life_style: free_living.

These samples have bad quality and the owner of the project has already recommended the remotion.

Observation:
In table "oceanic epipelagic zone biome", there is samples with project name called "single-cell metagenomics". Despite that, they are WGS sequencing.
